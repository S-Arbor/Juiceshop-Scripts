# Juiceshop-Scripts

Currently working through https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/.

This repo is just a spot to store my solutions, whether they're scripts or just a description.

If you somehow ended up here, I'm not experienced with cybersecurity so these probably aren't best practice and are the result of me following various other tutorials which I will link in each solution.
